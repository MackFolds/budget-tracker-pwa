# Budget Tracker ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## About/Description

  This project is a budget tracker app.  As users will need to be able to add transactions no matter the their internet connection.  In order to meet this user need, this application is setup as a PWA so users can access this from their phone or computer.  Users can add an icon to their home screen. It also utilizes IndexDB to store transactions if the user is offline and adds those transactions when the user re-connects to the internet. This application is loaded to Heroku though Iv tried everything and cant seem to fix the heroku deployment though everything else should be in good working order.
